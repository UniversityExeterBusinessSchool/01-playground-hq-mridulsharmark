# My Structure - Student 22

## What I See in My Data
[Two vertical columns of 4 bricks each and one horizontal row of 4 bricks on top, forming an arch shape with a width of 4, height of 4, and mainly yellow colour with 2 red bricks used due to shortage.]

## What I Think This Means
[The letters V and H represent vertical and horizontal placement of bricks, and the numbers indicate how many bricks should be used to form a stable arch structure.]

## What This Could Be
[A small LEGO archway that can represent a doorway, bridge entrance, or playground tunnel.]

## Questions I Have
[Does each letter represent one brick or one layer?]
